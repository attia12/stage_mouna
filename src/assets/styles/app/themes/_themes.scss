// Theme selection - only change this line to switch themes
@forward "lite-purple";

// This exports all variables from lite-purple as *
// When imported as namespace, all variables will be available under that namespace

// To use in component SCSS: 
// @use 'src/assets/styles/app/themes/themes' as theme;
// Then access variables like theme.$primary
